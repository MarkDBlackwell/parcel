======

This project grew out of my own personal frustrations with finding a garden to grow vegetables. I live in Boston, and gardening is impossible. I thought about indoor gardens, and while I think its a very cool idea, the extra stuff impeding on my minimal lifestyle always thwarted me. 

As an alternative, I signed up for the Fenway Gardens, and I never heard back from them. While at a Hackathon, I met an individual named Alex who came up with the idea of sharing vegetable gardens. My friend Jared and I built the first version in Meteor (We were playing around with the framework). After the Hackathon, I rewrote everything in Rails and here we have Parcel.
